"We had an emphasis or belief that we could really change society.  That we could really make a change – especially for me, I grew up in Newark, and you had seen a lot of things.  I had seen a lot of destruction, destructive lifestyles.  I saw people who were bright who never went anyplace in their life and it was a question that we were going to change this.  And it was that feeling that we were going to change this whole process that was going on.  We were going to be the group that starts something to happen.",

"…what could be changed or would be different.  It was also the era of Kennedy, the New Frontier, an advent thing that people had a chance to change their destinies, to make a change in regards to the world.  I think there was a lot of those type of thought patterns.  You also had some terrific leaders at that time, or speakers, who were very motivating, like Malcom X and Martin Luther King.  You had a lot of inspiration.  It was, I think, the spirit of the time, a thought pattern of what could be accomplished.  You could do anything.
